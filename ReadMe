Please Open File in The Master Branch "Only"!


This is the second project! This project is based on an giphy image search engine.
Today I will set up the editor and html to demonstrate the buttons needed for the menu bar with 
search engine. The design will be developed from the wireFrame.
The project wedsite allows users to search for coffee gif to see different types of animations.
The website show two gifs and allows the user to see additional coffee gifs upon request.
Technology used: HTML, CSS, and Javascript! 
Within the Mainjs file: The Key will need to be placed in line one and line eight, in order to unlock
the file.
If this file is open in replit, you will need to change the mainjs to scriptjs in order for the Javascript to 
link to page.
Future update: 
1.The plateform will need additional information added for the user to consider!
2.The design need to be ironed out a little more.
3.There need to be a counter of gifs located on the screen.
